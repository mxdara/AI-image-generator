# AI Image Generator

The AI Image Generator is a web application that generates images based on user input using the power of AI. The user can enter a prompt, which is a phrase that describes the type of image they want to generate, and the application will generate images based on that prompt.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Image Generator, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can then enter a prompt and click the "Generate" button to generate images.

## How it Works

The AI Image Generator uses two APIs to generate images based on user input: the OpenAI GPT-3 API and the Unsplash API.

The OpenAI GPT-3 API is a powerful language model that can generate text based on a given prompt. In this application, the user enters a prompt, and the GPT-3 API generates a description of the type of image the user wants to generate.

The Unsplash API is a database of high-quality images that can be searched using keywords. In this application, the description generated by the GPT-3 API is used to search for images on Unsplash. The images are then displayed on the page in a grid format.

## Prerequisites

This application requires a web browser to run.

## Built With

The AI Image Generator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the basic structure of the web page, including a container div that holds the header, form, and result sections. The CSS file styles the various elements on the page, including the container, header, form, and result sections. The JavaScript file contains the code that generates the images using the OpenAI GPT-3 API and the Unsplash API.
